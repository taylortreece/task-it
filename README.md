Task it is a portfolio project. It has been created as a minimum viable product for companies to keep track of users, teams, and a company's long term projects. The application allows an admin to create profiles for employees and team leaders. The users associated with the company are logged into specific teams. The admin can represent a company's long term projects by creating "projects", and break projects down to completable "segments" and "tasks". Segments can be assigned to teams for completion, while a segment's tasks are assigned to individual members of a segment's assigned team.
